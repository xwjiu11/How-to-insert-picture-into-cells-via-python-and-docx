How-to-insert-picture-into-cells-via-python-and-docx 

In 'insert_picture_into_cells.py',I define a methods to create a table and to add an image into the cells.<br>

insert_picture_into_cells.insert_picture(document=doc,rows=1,cols=1,picture_path="IMG_TEST.png",picture_width=3,picture_height=3)<br>
'document' means the document you're going to write<br>
'rows' and 'cols' means how many rows and how many cols of the table<br>
'picture_path' means where your picture is<br>
'picture_width''picture_height' very easy to understand,so you can custom your picture's width and height<br>
